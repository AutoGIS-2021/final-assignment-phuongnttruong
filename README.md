### Status

Once you are finished with the final assignment, edit this readme and add "x" to the correct box:

* [x] Submitted

* [ ] I'm still working on my final assignment. 


### Instructions

*you can remote these instructions for the final submission*

Read the final assignment instructions from the course webpages [https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/FA/final-assignment.html). Remember to write readable code, and to provide adequate documentation using inline comments and markdown. Organize all your code(s) / notebook(s) into this repository and **add links to all relevant files to this `README.md`file**. In sum, anyone who downloads this repository should be able to **read your code and documentation** and understand what is going on, and **run your code** in order to reproduce the same results! :) 

**Modify this readme so that anyone reading it gets a quick overview of your final work topic, and finds all the necessary input data, code and results.** 

*Note: If your code requires some python packages not found in the csc notebooks environment, please mention them also in this readme and provide installation instrutions.*

*Note: Don't upload large files into GitHub! If you are using large input files, provide downloading instructions and perhaps a small sample of the data in this repository for demonstrating your workflow.*

Fill in details of your final project below. You can remove this instructions-section from the README-file if you want.

## Topic: Popluations around all Healhcare stations in Helsinkis area and the shortest paths from my apartment to those health statations
I try to apply all the knowlegde that I have gained from AutoGis 1 and this course to analyze the population around all health stations in Helsinki area, visualize and calculate the distant as well as the shortest path from my apartment to those area.

### Structure of this repository:
health stations' address is in the file health_center.txt 
open html and chart of my map from index.md file

### Input data:
sourse for health centers: https://www.hel.fi/en/health-and-social-services/health-care/health-stations
sourse for population in helsinki area: http://geo.stat.fi/geoserver/vaestoruutu/wfs?service=wfs&version=2.0.0&request=describeFeatureType
sourse for skills where i have learnt: all are from the autogis processes course: https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html


### Analysis steps:
I can devide this final assignment to 3 main steps:
1) fetching data:
+using panda to read txt file
+using open street map to restreive the shortest path
+using request to webcraping data
2) analyze the data
using all knowlege to analyze data such as distance and population of each health station
3) visualization
+using folium to build the interactive map
+using mapplotlib to plot and analyze the data


### Results:
i am kinda happy with my result, work well with my idea.
