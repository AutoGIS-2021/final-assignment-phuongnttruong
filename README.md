# Final Assignment


## Topic: Popluations around all Healhcare stations in Helsinkis area and the shortest paths from my apartment to those health statations
I try to apply all the knowlegde that I have gained from AutoGis 1 and this course to analyze the population around all health stations in Helsinki area, visualize and calculate the distant as well as the shortest path from my apartment to those area.

### Structure of this repository:
health stations' address is in the file health_center.txt 
open html and analyze chart of my map from index.md file

### Input data:
sourse for health centers: https://www.hel.fi/en/health-and-social-services/health-care/health-stations

sourse for skills where i have learnt: all are from the autogis processes course: https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html


### Analysis steps:
I can devide this final assignment to 3 main steps:
1) fetching data:
+using panda to read txt file
+using open street map to restreive the shortest path
+using request to webcraping data
2) analyze the data
using all knowlege to analyze data such as distance and population of each health station
3) visualization
+using folium to build the interactive map
+using mapplotlib to plot and analyze the data


### Results:
I am happy with my result, work well with my idea.
