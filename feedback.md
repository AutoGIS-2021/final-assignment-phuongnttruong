## Final assignment 

### Grade: 4.5

### Comments:

Very well done! You have shown in this final assignment, and throughout the weekly exercises, that you have a good understanding of what has been taught in this course. Below are some comments and suggestions, but all in all I think that you have done a good job during this course, and get a well deserved grade. Congrats!

Btw, I'm setting your repository as private, since your grades are visible in this document, and then you can decide whether you want it public or not afterwards.

- Documentation:
	- Your readme-file is short and to the point, which is nice. But you could also add a bit more descriptive text on what the repository does.
    - Your inline comments are generally good and informative. 
    - In your Markdown cells, you could be more informative about what is going on and describe a bit more, although I like that you print out revelant information along the way. That gives the user a good feeling of what is happening to the data.

- Analysis, visualizations & code: 
	- Your analysis is straight forward and you utilize several aspects and techniques from the course.
    - It would have been nice if you were able to modularize your code a bit, making it easier to reuse with for example some functions. That could make it easier to fetch data for several areas and combine them. 
    - Your map is nice, although an idea would be to map the starting location for the routes, and also to add the buffer visually as a seperate layer.
